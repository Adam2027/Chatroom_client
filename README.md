# Chatroom_client_BUGFIX_V1.0
this is code that lets you connect to our chatting server letting you chat with others live realtime over python
The IP adress will be updated monthly as it changes.
Remember to be respectful towards others, new files will be uploaded to my github.
Old files will eather be overwirtten or will be removed and replaced with the new client python file.
In our "Soon new" client we will have implemnted a feature to the server and python client that will check if your client ID of 60 charecters matches to the server and if it does not your connection will be refused and you will not be able to connect. this is done to prevent old client versions from connecting to the server witch contain bugs and outdated features.
